# Project 1 - *Vincent's RPG Profile*

Submitted by: **Vincent Bender

Vincent's RPG Profile is an app that introduces myself in the format of a video game character. I drew all the sprites and art for it then put everything together in the style of a retro video game.

Time spent: 6 hours spent in total on coding and an additonal 3 on the art for the app

## Required Features

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [!] Users are able to see a customized app icon and launch screen
- [!] Your app should work for any screen size and orientation using AutoLayout constraints
- [!] Users are able to see at least 3 context items
- [!] Users are able to tap into each context item and see detail view contains information about each item (title, description, picture if applicable, etc.)
 
The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [!] Improve and customize the user interface through styling and coloring

The following **additional** features are implemented:

## Notes

The main challenge was making the app fit the constraints and work properly across different layouts while still having the general weirdness of a lot of older games. I wanted a fun layout and to do something different but I am happy with the result. The additional stepper was also a challenge as it took some debugging for it to work properly.
